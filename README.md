# discord-bot
This is a bot I wrote for the chat application called [Discord](https://discordapp.com/). It is built upon the [Discord.JS](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/) framework.

Command list:
```
!ping                       | Makes the bot respond "pong"  
!game                       | Makes the bot return the name of the game you're currently playing  
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)                    | Easter egg  
!overwatch *username-1234*  | Returns overwatch data from the unofficial Blizzard Overwatch API. The data is fetched from api.lootbox.eu/documentation  
!lolgame *summonername*     | Returns live game stats for your the match that *summonername* is currently in. Only the EUW server is supported at this time  

```

EDIT: THESE ARE ALL OUTDATED AND ARE COMMANDS FROM OLD_BOT.JS - WILL EDIT THIS README TO REFLECT NEW COMMANDS FROM FUNKTHULHU.JS AT SOME POINT.
